# Business Workload Management System

This project is made as part of a University Module.

# Project Specification

This project should design and create a workload management system on a Web System.
The web application should be an informative way to have an overview of the company’s manpower strengthen at any timeand get more informative availabilities of employees and engagement.

The system is expected to provide an interactive and visual way for the employee to see their job assignments, working hours engaged/assigned, and for employees to inform the system of their availabilities.<br>Employees should be able to indicate to the company any assigned jobs they cannot fulfil ahead of time.<br>To assist with the workload planning, employees should be able to indicate their
availabilities up to one month earlier.

The administrative staff (usually the manager) should be able to visualise the manpower availability at any time up to one month earlier.<br>Hence, the system is expected to provide an interactive and visual
way for the administrative staff to visualise manpower availabilities, job assignments, and allocate
jobs. Individual employee workload and availabilities should be able to be visualised at a glance.

### Target Company

The web application will be made for a Security Company.

In the security officer division, work allocation is assigned weekly every Monday. The workload
allocation planning will start every Thursday of the week. Hence, all employee’s availabilities must
be informed in the system every Wednesday to be considered in the planning. If employees miss the
weekly deadline, requests would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

The weekly roster is dependent on the security officer preferred area and availability. Currently, the company
have a team of fifty-eight officers, twenty leaders, and three chiefs.<br>All sites are tenured on a 2-year
basis. The area of service hierarchy is the site itself; an area consists of two of more sites within a
10km radius, and at all times there will be a chief overseeing all areas, which double up as the
manager of the security officer division. All security officers will report to the site leader, and the
various site leaders will report to an area leader. Finally, the area leaders will report to the chief.

The company classifies tenured sites into small and large sizes and number of manned gates. There
are two levels of security at a site. Below is the company’s manpower allocation based on the site
classification.

|                             | Basic level of Security                            | Enhanced level of Security                             |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Small site  (1 manned gate) | 1 site leader and 1 security officers at all times | 1 site leader and 3 security officers at all times     |
| Large site  (1 manned gate) | 1 site leader and 1 security officers at all times | 1 site leader and 4 security officers at all times     |
| Large Site  (N manned gate) | 1 site leader and N security officers at all times | 1 site leader and 3 + N security officers at all times |

Each shift is 12 hours long. Only Area leaders and Chiefs are expected to travel between sites. Hence, they are provided with company cars.
